        <p>Hello! My name is <strong>theurg1st</strong>.</p>

        <p>
            I am a developer and programmer working with
            C++, C, Assembly, GLua, HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            Node.js, Vue.js, PHP, and Python.
        </p>

        <p>
            I am writing this message regarding my ban on the
            <strong>Awesome Te4m Discord server</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            I want to be completely honest:<br>
            the reason for my ban was that I sent <strong>18+ images</strong>
            to members of the Discord server.<br>
            I fully admit that this behavior was wrong, inappropriate,
            and against the rules.
        </p>

        <p>
            I accept full responsibility for my actions.<br>
            I understand that I deserved the punishment, and I acknowledge
            that you are not obligated to unban me.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, I would like to sincerely ask for a
            <strong>second chance</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            At the time, I was young and immature, and I did not fully
            understand the consequences of my actions. Since then, I have
            reflected on what I did, and I genuinely regret it. I can honestly
            say that I have changed and learned from this mistake.
        </p>

        <p>
            I know that my previous unban request was declined by you
            (<strong>Doctor What</strong>), but I am respectfully trying
            one more time.
        </p>


        <p>
            Once again, I understand that you owe me nothing.<br>
            I simply hope that you can see how much I want to make things right
            and how important this opportunity is to me.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thank you very much for your time and consideration.
        </p>
